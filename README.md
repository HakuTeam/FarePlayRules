## As a team member
1. I do my best to finish tasks on time.
2. If I do not have time, this is not a problem - I write a message to the team as soon as possible. If sone else is free he/she can take the task.
3. If I have a problem I ask the others for help as soon as possible.
4. If somone needs help I help as soon as possible.
5. If there is a problem I do not blame - I try to suggest a solution.
6. If I have time and want to work, I ask team members for a new task or I take a task from the list Back Log here: https://github.com/HakuTeam/AlphaBomberman/projects/1
